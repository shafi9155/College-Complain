# College Complaint
* Devloped to help college students to address and resolve issues and
complaints related to the mess, academics, and the hostel.
* Allows students to submit their complaints online and enables college
administrators to manage and resolve complaints efficiently.
* The complaints submitted will be automatically routed to the
respective authorities responsible for addressing them and if not resolved in the time frame then automatically routed to the next higher authority.
* Students can track the status of their complaints on the studentâ€™s
dashboard
*The status of the complaints can be viewed by the authorities on the staff dashboard, and they can also provide updates, follow the complaints' progress, and escalate them to higher authorities if needed.
## Motivation
* To address issues faced by college students which lacks an efficient
and convenient way to raise their concerns and have them addressed
in a timely manner.
* Colleges still rely on traditional methods such as paper-based forms,
emails, or phone calls to handle complaints, which can be
time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to errors.
* Our project aims to provide an online platform that can make the
complaint handling process more transparent and accountable.
